        I sewed smalled coral from fun patterned fabric. My coral are stuffed

        to touch them and play with them lightly.
        Parts of the coral's dyed color is fading and their colorful patterns are only left on some 
        fragments of them, evoking the reality of the beautiful colors leaving 
        coral in our oceans due to coral bleaching.

        `I developed a program to produce star cluster evolution animations as would be 
        observed and photographed by Hubble Telescope and by James Webb Space Telescope 
        for given star cluster evolution models. The program produces images applying 
        the color filters and point spread functions of the desired telescope, for 
        each given stars' position, radius and luminosity, then stitches all images 
        into a video showing the star clusters' evolution over time. 
        
        Star clusters can have a lifespan of hundreds of millions of years, which
         is far beyond the time that Hubble Space Telescope or James Webb Space 
         Telescope are able to observe. By producing these videos we are able to 
         better understand what a star cluster evolution process would look like 
         visually if it were to be seen through a telescope. It allows for better
         visualization of the different evolution models that are being developed 
         by physicists, giving them also a visually more realistic way to present
         their star cluster evolution models.

        I presented my work and research process for producing these animations 
        with the following research poster.

        This work was made in collaboration with Professor Carl Rodriguez (University of North
         Carolina) and Dr Ugo Niccoló Di Carlo.`,

        `I was part of the team of students at Carnegie Mellon University working
         to send the Iris Lunar Rover to the Moon. This is a simulation I made 
         for the Iris lunar rover team during mission when the rover was aboard 
         Peregrine Mission One, a mission aiming to land on the Moon in January 2024. 
         Astrobotic's Peregrine lander was intended to land on the Moon, yet was 
         not able to attempt a Lunar landing due to a propulsion issue. Since a 
         lunar landing was not possible the Iris lunar rover team explored 
         alternatives. A hypothetical scenario that we explored (yet never executed) 
         included deploying the rover in space to obtain lander images of the 
         rover in space and for Iris to capture an image of the lander from space. 
         This simulation was made to visualize this hypothetical situation to the 
         Iris team and the Astrobotic team, by showing the views from both front 
         and back rover cameras, and a lander camera upon deployment, as well as 
         a general view of the rover trajectory calculated using accurate physics. 
         I produced this simulation using Unity.
         Note: the Iris rover was never deployed in space.

        description:
        `I collaborated as a programmer in developing the Unity game 'That Time I 
        Got Reincarnated As A Ferret and Forced to Climb for My Freedom', together 
        with Hanke Chen (programmer and music) and Ashley Kim (producer and artist).

        'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Ferret and Forced to Climb for My Freedom' 
        is a fun game in which a ferret needs to grab onto colorful rocks to climb out 
        of a hole while random objects of increasingly bigger size fall into the hole. 

        My role in the game involved programming several aspects of the game:
        - A grid based and path based random object placement algorithm to place 
        the climbing rocks, such that each time the game someone plays the game 
        it generates a new map of colored rocks.
        - A rock grabbing detection game mechanism, such that the game detects when 
        the ferret can grab a rock, has grabbed a rock or lets go of a rock, and 
        whether the ferret is grabbing onto any rocks or should fall.
        - Dropping of random objects, at timed intervals which get shorter the higher
        a player climbs. The dropped objects also get larger as the player climbs.
        - I programmed and animated the game condition such that the ferret 
        floats upwards once it grabs the trophy, then eventually the ferret falls back
        into the ferret hole and reincarnates as a random object. This shows a 'You Won'
        page. If the ferret falls it falls to the bottom of the hole, and this shows a 
        'You Lost' page.  
        - I also implemented the mini-map feature of the game to show the current 
        location of the ferret within the full height of the climbing wall, to show
        the player their progress.

        functions to convert handwritten text images to text
        - Trained neural network on handwritten text image data set using one 
        hidden layer with 64 hidden units for 30 epochs, and used network to parse 
        text in new images

        Video Tracking Alignment
        - Wrote program to track an object with a bounding box throughout a video, 
        including objects moving away from or closer to the camera and passing behind 
        other objects
        - Implemented Lucas-Kanade forward additive alignment algorithm with 
        translation as well as with full-affine transformation for video tracking 
        (additive increment to warp parameters each frame)
        - Optimized computational performance with implementation of Matthews-Baker 
        inverse compositional alignment, gradient descent algorithm with affine 
        transformation (with direct warp update per frame)

        Rasterizer
        - Implemented rasterizer in software (C++) including line and triangle 
        rasterization, depth testing and blending, perspective correct attribute 
        interpolation, mip-mapping and supersampling

        Geometric Mesh Editing
        - Developed interactive mesh editing of triangular meshes, implementing 
        vertex, edge and face operations such as edge splitting, edge and face 
        collapse, face extrude, edge and vertex dissolve 
        - Implemented mesh triangulation, Catmull-Clark mesh subdivision, and 
        isometric remeshing operations

        I completed these projects as part of the Computer Vision and Computer 
        Graphics courses at Carnegie Mellon University.
